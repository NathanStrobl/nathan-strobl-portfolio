## Welcome!
Hello, and welcome to my portfolio website! Before we begin, I want to express my gratitude for investing your valuable time into exploring my work amidst your busy schedule; I hope that you feel this was a worthwhile investment by the end of your visit. Here, you’ll find some insights into who I am, what my interests are, and the aspirations I have for my career. In addition to this, you will find a collection of my software projects, both completed and ongoing, that showcase my programming and problem-solving abilities.

Without further ado, let’s jump in!

## A Bit About Me
### Background
I am currently in my second year at Rochester Institute of Technology, majoring in Software Engineering with aspirations to pursue a Minor in Computer Engineering. At RIT, I also hold a position as a technician in the university’s Dining division, where I focus on troubleshooting POS equipment and deploying new computer setups. During my academic journey, I have developed an interest in web development, and I now dedicate a significant portion of my free time to enhancing my program skills through web-based projects; one notable example is the web portal that I developed to house student-made internal tools and streamline the workflows of myself and my colleagues, which you can read  more about [here](/ritasp/overview/). 

### My Passions
My greatest passion lies in employing logic and critical thinking to tackle challenges of many sizes. While programming serves as the prime example of this passion, this is not the only avenue in which I use a logical and analytical approach; for example, I also enjoy testing these skills by tinkering with various electronic devices including Arduinos, 3D printers, and hi-fi audio equipment. This isn’t to say that my interests are confined solely to logical activities: in fact, I hold an equally strong passion for visual aesthetics and product design. When I get the itch to express myself creatively in this manner, two of my primary outlets are developing intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces for my software and designing physical products for 3D printing and sale.

### Outside of Programming
When seeking a break from technology-centric hobbies, I often turn to the outdoors; specifically, I enjoy commuting to work and school using my bike, for it satisfies both my desire to be outdoors (especially during the winter months) and my commitment to reducing my carbon footprint. Socializing with colleagues serves as another escape from technology, and I find that engaging in conversations and exchanging ideas with my peers enhances both my personal and professional growth. While these activities may not involve critical thinking in the traditional sense, I find them useful for maintaining my mental and physical health, and for ensuring that I will be able to perform optimally when partaking in more intellectually challenging tasks.

## My Career Aspirations
### What I Want To Do
In terms of programming, my primary ambition is to be a full-stack web and mobile developer, for I find satisfaction in both the logical side of constructing backend software and the creative side of designing user interfaces and experiences. While I have a preference for this facet of software engineering, my ultimate goal is to innovate and problem-solve, regardless of the specific tools or technologies involved. Learning also plays a crucial role in my professional aspirations, as I continuously seek to acquire new skills to further my pursuit of innovation. Whether it involves mastering new technologies and programming techniques, or developing non-technical skills such as business acumen, leadership, and customer relations, I am deeply passionate about learning and professional growth. 

### The Environment I Want To Work In 
My ideal work environment is one that fosters innovation and welcomes new ideas with enthusiasm rather than skepticism. I prefer an atmosphere that is casual and lighthearted, yet maintains a professional focus on producing high-quality products. As someone who loves to collaborate with others, I value having coworkers who are outgoing, collaborative, and enjoyable to talk to; this extends to management as well, and it is equally important to me that I have a manager who communicates with their employees in a friendly and approachable manner and strives to create a positive work environment. Ultimately, I seek an environment that allows me to leverage my skills and creativity to produce great things, build connections with others, and enjoy every step of the process.
