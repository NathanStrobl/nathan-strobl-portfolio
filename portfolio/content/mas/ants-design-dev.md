## TL;DR
With [CATS](/mas/cats) automating single-radio integration testing and replacing much of the functionality previously 
handled by BTS, the next major testing gap to address was inter-radio communication. ANTS is designed to fill this gap 
by focusing exclusively on how multiple radios communicate and interact with one another, and its primary goal mirrors 
that of CATS: reduce the risk of software regressions going unnoticed and spiraling into much bigger issues. Due to the 
increased scope and complexity of multi-radio testing, ANTS’s development has been split across my final two internship 
semesters at MAS, with the first phase centered on designing and implementing the system’s core architecture. ANTS 
operates over MAS’s local network using a three-layer design consisting of a Pytest-based test layer, a middleware 
coordination layer, and node machines that are connected directly to radios; these layers communicate and coordinate 
with each other through WebSocket connections using custom messages and a shared API. Like CATS, ANTS is intended to 
integrate with GitLab CI; however, because these tests are significantly more complex and time-consuming, these 
pipelines will be limited to running nightly, providing results to engineers the following morning. With the conclusion 
of my second semester at MAS, ANTS’s design has been implemented and largely finalized, setting the stage for 
integrating this test suite into our pipelines and firmware development processes. 

## Background
With [CATS](/mas/cats) having addressed the need for single-radio integration tests, the next logical step was to move 
up the testing pyramid and implement a system for performing automated end-to-end testing of inter-radio communication.

While CATS’s ability to automate integration tests through GitLab CI has been effective in reducing the risk of firmware 
regressions at the individual radio level, this was not yet the case for scenarios involving multiple radios interacting 
with one another. Bringing the same level of automation to end-to-end testing comes with significant benefits, 
particularly in catching more complex failures earlier in the development process. Building a new end-to-end testing 
suite would also allow MAS to retire the legacy BTS testing software, which has grown unreliable and increasingly 
difficult to maintain as engineers have prioritized more important tasks; additionally, ANTS allows us to start off with 
a clean slate with a focused purpose, rather than trying to handle both integration and end-to-end testing in a single, 
manually operated application. Building on several of the ideas and constructs developed for CATS, I set out to design a 
new system specifically tailored to this task.

## Overall Design and Operation
intro

### The ANTS Network
To coordinate and test multiple radios simultaneously, ANTS could not follow the same one-machine approach as CATS. In 
addition to the need for multiple radios, all of which require their own host computer, the behaviors targeted by ANTS 
require interaction with a separate piece of software (which I will refer to as M) that only runs on Windows; this is 
especially problematic for MAS’s development team, as most engineers use Linux as their main environment. To accommodate 
these constraints, ANTS is designed as a three-layer system, with each layer serving a distinct role:

- The testing layer is a Pytest-based application responsible for orchestrating tests; it achieves this by issuing 
  commands to the radios and asserting they behave as expected. 

- The node layer consists of all radios present in the test session, each connected to their own Windows machine; nodes 
  are primarily responsible for executing actions through the M software when commanded to by the testing layer and 
  sending log messages generated by the radios back for analysis.

- Sitting between these layers is a middleware application that coordinates all WebSocket connections within the ANTS 
  Network, implements some additional logic relevant to testing, and forwards messages to their appropriate 
  destinations.
