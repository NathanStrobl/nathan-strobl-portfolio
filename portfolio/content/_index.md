## Welcome!
Hello, and welcome to my portfolio website! Before we begin, I want to express my gratitude for taking the time to 
explore my work. Here, you’ll find some insights into who I am, what my interests are, and the aspirations I have for my 
career. In addition to this, you will find a collection of my software projects, both completed and ongoing, that 
showcase my programming and problem-solving abilities.

Without further ado, let’s jump in!

## A Bit About Me
### Background
I am currently pursuing my Software Engineering degree at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). Right now, I am doing 
a one-year internship at Metrea Advanced Signals, and I will be going back to school to complete my final year of
schooling in the fall of 2026.

During my time at RIT, I have developed an interest in several facets of software engineering and development, ranging
from making websites to working on embedded software projects to tinkering with Unix-like operating systems. I now also
dedicate a good portion of my free time to learning as much as I can about all things software.

### My Passions
My greatest passion lies in employing logic and critical thinking to tackle challenges of many sizes. While programming 
serves as the prime example of this passion, this is not the only avenue in which I use a logical and analytical 
approach; for example, I also enjoy testing these skills by tinkering with various electronic devices including 
Arduinos, 3D printers, and hi-fi audio equipment. This isn’t to say that my interests are confined solely to logical 
activities: in fact, I hold an equally strong passion for visual aesthetics and product design. When I get the itch to 
express myself creatively in this manner, two of my primary outlets are developing intuitive and visually appealing user 
interfaces for my software and designing physical products for 3D printing and sale.

> holding more cards, and which rolls around for easier passing between players.

### Outside of Programming
When seeking a break from technology-centric hobbies, I often turn to the outdoors; I enjoy taking hikes while 
practicing my photography, as well as walking or biking to places whenever possible. Socializing, engaging in 
conversations, and exchanging ideas with colleagues and peers serves as another escape from technology.

## My Career Aspirations
### What I Want To Do
My ultimate goal at any job (and personal project, for that matter) is to innovate and problem-solve, regardless of the 
specific tools or technologies involved. Learning also plays a crucial role in my professional aspirations, as I 
continuously seek to acquire new skills. Whether it involves mastering new technologies and programming techniques, or 
developing non-technical skills such as business acumen, leadership, and customer relations, I am deeply passionate 
about learning and professional growth. 

### The Environment I Want To Work In 
My ideal work environment is one that fosters innovation and welcomes new ideas with enthusiasm. I prefer an atmosphere 
that is casual and lighthearted, yet maintains a professional focus on producing high-quality products. As someone who 
loves to collaborate with others, I value having coworkers who are outgoing, collaborative, and enjoyable to talk to; 
this extends to management as well, and it is equally important to me that I have a manager who communicates with their 
employees in a friendly and approachable manner and strives to create a positive work environment. Ultimately, I seek an 
environment that allows me to leverage my skills and creativity to produce great things, build connections with others, 
and enjoy every step of the process.
